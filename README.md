# Wise Game

This is a small maths game I made for the student fair.


## Flutter

For help getting started with Flutter, view 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

(You might also need to run something like flutter build ios, after first opening the project)
To run it I opened the iOS folder with XCode, ran pod install, connected an iPad to my Mac and ran the come from XCode.


## Game Guide

The point of this game is to show that Wise is always the better option, compared to a regular bank.

The goal is to choose which one is better (Hint, it's **always Wise**. And you have to write the **difference** in the input field.
